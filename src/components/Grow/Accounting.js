       <h4 align="left" > What Is Accounting </h4>
 <p>Accounting for startups involves tracking the inflows and outflows of cash 
 and summarizing this data into financial statements that can, later on, 
 be used to analyze the business’ performance. Now, don’t confuse bookkeeping with accounting. 
 Bookkeeping is the actual process of recording all of your business transactions.
It doesn’t involve a lot of analytical work, in contrast to accounting,
which focuses more on the in-depth financial evaluation of the business. As a startup founder, </p>
<img className="double" src="/accounting/accounting-cycle-process.jpg" alt="" />

<h6  align="left" >some of the most common financial activities you’ll have to deal with are:</h6>
<ul >
<li>Daily bookkeeping. This involves tasks like processing payments, making journal entries,creating financial reports, and so on.</li>
<li>	Creating & sending invoices to clients.</li>
<li>Checking payables and receivables to make sure clients are transferring payments on time.</li>
<li>Making sure cash flow is able to meet upcoming expenses.</li>
<li>Calculating tax liabilities and filing for tax returns.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a lot of documentation that goes into each one of the tasks above. 
Tracking and documenting the above could be done manually (on spreadsheets and physical folders) 
or through automated accounting software. We don’t recommend the manual method, though. 
The accounting process is long and complex, so writing everything down by hand (or typing it) isn’t convenient unless you’re 
running a very small business. It can be time-consuming, tiring, and leaves plenty of room for accounting errors.</p>

          <h4 align="left">Accounting Essentials You Should Know</h4><br/>
          <h6 align="left" >The Accounting Equation</h6>
    <p> The accounting equation shows the relationship between three main entities of your startup:
                 Assets, Liabilities, and Equity.
      Assets are the resources, equipment, cash your startup owns.
    Liabilities are the wages, debts, taxes your startup owes.
    The owner’s equity is what’s left after you subtract liabilities from assets
       So, the accounting equation looks like this:</p>
       Assets = Liabilities + Owners Equity
       <p>When a business keeps correct recordings of their transactions, the accounting equation always balances. Meaning, the left side always equals the right.</p>
       <h6 align="left" >	Double-entry bookkeeping</h6> 
      
       <h6 align="left" > Chart of Accounts</h6> 
       <p>Assets are the resources, equipment, cash your startup owns.
Liabilities are the wages, debts, taxes your startup owes.
The owner’s equity is what’s left after we differentiate assets and liabilities (as previously mentioned in the accounting equation section)
Revenue is what the startup makes from sales or other activities.
      Expenses are the costs of operating the business.</p>
      <h6 align="left" > Balance Sheet</h6> 	
<p>The balance sheet represents assets, liabilities, and equity at a particular date. 
  This financial statement is unique in that it reports information for a specific day, 
  not for an extended period of time (a month, a year). The balance sheet is
   based upon the accounting equation, which we explained above:</p>
Assets = Liabilities + Owner’s Equity.
<p>For that reason, the statement is divided into two sections (left and right) as shown below:</p>

      <h6 align="left" > 1. To support planning for growth</h6>
      <p>For your startup to grow and scale, you'll likely need capital. For external funding, expertly prepared financial statements and cash flow projections can help convince investors and lenders that your business will be profitable and offer them a good return on investment.</p>
      <h6 align="left" > 2. To help in raising funding from investors or selling your business</h6>
     <p>As mentioned earlier in this article, if you're looking to take out a business loan, line of credit, or raise venture capital, your financial reports must follow GAAP. Experienced accountants understand the GAAP system, which uses the accrual accounting method, and can prepare you for exit scenarios such as mergers, acquisitions, or initial public offerings. </p>
      <h6 align="left" > 3. To properly collect money due to your business</h6>
      <p>Accounts receivable (A/R) represents the money your business expects to receive from customers for the goods or services you’ve provided. The efficient collection of your A/R is essential to your business's cash flow. These figures are a necessary to calculate your profitability and provide the most precise gauge of your startup's revenue. </p>
      <h6 align="left" > 4. To remaining compliant</h6>
      <p>Whether you’re at the beginning stages of building your startup or planning for future growth, using a GAAP-compliant accounting system will help prepare your business to scale to any size. From correctly categorizing and storing financial records to establishing clear controls and approval workflows, every effort counts to stay ahead of potential audits (which are more common than startups may think!). A fundraising round, due diligence for an acquisition, or applying for a bank loan or line of credit could require a startup to undergo a financial audit.</p>
      <h6 align="left" > 5. For paying taxes correctly</h6>
      <p>A solid accounting system managed by experts will make tax return preparation all that much easier and more accurate. It will also ensure you can maximize your tax deduction opportunities, like the R&D tax credit (Research & Experimentation Tax Credit), which offers additional tax credit incentives for companies pursuing innovation. If your accounts are not in order, you’ll likely miss out on maximizing this serious tax benefit for startups.</p>

        <Accordion.Body>
         <p>Accounting can be classified into two categories – financial accounting and managerial accounting.</p>
         <img className="type" src="/accounting/typefofaccount.png" alt="" />
       <h6 align="left">1. Financial Accounting</h6>
       <p>Financial accounting involves the preparation of accurate financial statements. The focus of financial accounting is to measure the performance of a business as accurately as possible. While financial statements are for external use, they may also be for internal management use to help make decisions.
     Accounting principles and standards, such as US GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) or IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards), are standards that are widely adopted in financial accounting. The accounting standards are important because they allow all stakeholders and shareholders to easily understand and interpret the reported financial statements from year to year.</p>
     <h6 align="left">2. Managerial Accounting</h6>
       <p>Managerial accounting analyzes the information gathered from financial accounting. It refers to the process of preparing reports about business operations. The reports serve to assist the management team in making strategic and tactical business decisions.
Managerial accounting is a process that allows an enterprise to achieve maximum efficiency by reviewing accounting information, deciding on the best next steps to follow, and then communicating these next steps to internal business managers.
An example of managerial accounting is cost accounting. Cost accounting focuses on a detailed break-up of costs for effective cost control. Managerial accounting is very important in the decision-making process.</p>

        <h5 align="left">Fundamentals of Accounting Principles</h5>
        <p>Accounting is the procedure of data entry, recording, summarizing, analyzing, and then reporting the data related to financial transactions of businesses and corporations. Fundamentals of accounting are guiding principles to perform such tasks. Operations of a business entity over an accounting period, generally a year, are keys to prepare financial statements. A company uses accounts to measure where it stands in the economic sense. They help in decision-making as well as cost planning and assessment. Above all, accounting reports are of utmost importance to outside entities as well, viz., the investors, creditors, and regulatory bodies. Professionals across the world use a set of standards- “GAAP– Generally Accepted Accounting Principles” for preparing these reports.</p>
<h6 align="left"> 1.Revenue Recognition Principle</h6>
<p>According to this principle, revenue recognition happens at the time of execution of the transaction—irrespective of receipt of payment or cash. More importantly, the sale of goods or services should be complete, and payment should be due for it. Also, the associated costs are booked during the same period.</p>
<h6 align="left">2. Historical Cost Principle</h6>
<p>This principle directs that all assets will be reported at the actual cost of acquisition and not at their current market value. There is an exception to this rule for highly marketable securities. They are valued at their fair market value. Intangible assets with impairments are also shown at their appropriate market values. Thus, this principle ensures a reasonable value/cost of the assets reported.</p>
<h6 align="left">3.Matching Principle</h6>
<p>The matching principle directs that income earned during an accounting period is compared with corresponding expenditure. Similarly, all the costs related to the sale or revenue reported in a particular period be taken into account in that period only.</p>
<h6 align="left">4.Full Disclosure Principle</h6>
<p>The full disclosure principle states that an entity’s books of accounts should fully disclose all the relevant information to its users. Also, there should be no deliberate concealment of information. The idea and objective are that concerned people should be able to make proper and well-informed decisions based on the reports.</p>
<h6 align="left">5.Objectivity Principle</h6>
<p>This principle states that all the information in the books of accounts should be objective, reliable, and accurate. Also, they should be free from the personal bias of the reporting persons. Above all, every transaction should be backed with adequate evidence, such as vouchers, receipts, invoices, etc., as support.</p>

        <Accordion.Body>
<h5  align="left"> What are Accounting Policies?</h5>
<img className="" src="/accounting/Accounting-Policies-1.jpg" alt="" />
<p>Accounting Policies are internal rules, standards, and procedures that a company’s management lays down to guide them in the preparation of accounts. Basically, these policies help with the accounting, setting up measuring systems, as well as in the presentation of accounts.Such policies are very useful when recording complex accounting activities. These activities include which depreciation method to use, how to treat R&D expenses, goodwill recognition, valuing inventory, and more.</p>
      <h4 align="left">Accounting Policies </h4>
       <h6 align="left">1. framework:</h6>
       <p>To articulate the company’s financial affairs, it needs to prepare financial statements. And the financial statements prepared without any guidance would have no coherence within them. They help find out the coherence between financial statements. Accounting policy also offers a robust framework to follow so that the company may adhere to the right structure and prepare its financial statements.</p>
       <h6 align="left">2.Disclosure:</h6>
       <p>A company must disclose what accounting policy they have been following. Since accounting standards represent items in many ways, proper accounting policy disclosure is essential.</p>
       <h6 align="left">3.Providing advantage to investors:</h6>
       <p>If the companies mention the accounting policy they used to produce the financial statements, it will also help the investors. By stating the accounting policy, the companies ensure that they have maintained coherence while providing financial statements. This coherence helps the investors look at the financial statements and compare them with other companies from similar and different industries.</p>
       <h6 align="left">4.The government can keep a hold on the company’s financial statements:</h6>
      <p>All the financial statements prepared are as per the accounting policy, and companies always follow a proper structure. These companies also need to keep in mind that they can only follow the accounting policy made as per GAAP or IFRS
. Thus, the government can have a direct hold on the company’s financial statements
, and the government can protect the interest of the investors.</p>

        <h4 align="left">What Is Tax Accounting?</h4>
          <p>Tax accounting is a structure of accounting methods focused on taxes rather than the appearance of public financial statements. In short, tax accounting is the means of accounting for tax purposes.
Tax accounting is governed by the Internal Revenue Code, which dictates the specific rules that companies and individuals must follow when preparing their tax returns. Tax accounting applies to everyone—individuals, businesses, corporations, and other entities. Even those who are exempt from paying taxes must participate in tax accounting. The purpose of tax accounting is to be able to track funds (funds coming in as well as funds going out) associated with individuals and entities.</p>
        <h6 align="left">KEY TAKEAWAYS</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Tax accounting is the subsector of accounting that deals with the preparations of tax returns and tax payments.</li>
        <li>Tax accounting is used by individuals, businesses, corporations and other entities.</li>
        <li>Tax accounting for an individual focuses on income, qualifying deductions, donations, and any investment gains or losses.</li>
       <li>For a business, tax accounting is more complex, with greater scrutiny regarding how funds are spent and what is or isn't taxable.</li>
        </ul>
        <img className="" src="/accounting/Tax-Accounting.jpg" alt="" />
        <h4 align="left">Basics of Tax accounting</h4>
       <h6 align="left">1.Deferred Tax asset:</h6> <p>Is generated when there is a difference in book profit, and taxable profit arises due to a timing issue. There are expenses like provision for doubtful debts, which are considered for deduction in accounting in the current year. However, these are allowed for a deduction for taxation only when the amount is declared as bad debt, which can happen in the coming years.In this case, the taxable profit will be higher compared to accounting profit, and the person or organization will pay more taxes this year, which. The extra amount paid as tax on incremental profit due to rejection of provision amount for deduction is considered as deferred tax, which will be realized in the coming years.</p> 
      <h6 align="left">2.Deferred Tax liability</h6><p>Deferred Tax Liabilityis generated when the person or organization has to pay fewer taxes in the current year due to the timing difference. For example – let’s consider that an asset of $10,000 is being depreciated in accounting books under (SLM) straight-line method
 for 8 year– the depreciation each year will be $1,250 ($10,000/8).
However,if the tax rules state that assets have to be depreciated @20% (WDV) written down value method.The depreciation for taxation purpose in second year will be $1,600 (($10,000 – 2000 i.e. 20% for first-year) = $8,000*20% = $1,600)).
Here the organization will get an extra deduction of $350 ($1,600-$1,250) for taxation purposes. If we consider the tax rate to be 30%, the deferred tax liability here is $105 ($350*30%).</p>
   <h6 align="left">3.VAT Accounting</h6>   <p> Most of the countries a Good & Service Tax (GST) or VAT (value-added tax)
, which forms part of almost all the invoices issued. Now, this should not be considered as expenses directly because the organizations get an Input Tax credit on the amount already paid. To claim those inputs, the tax authorities lay certain conditions regarding the format of invoice, name, and registration of the company, details of the second part, etc. and all these conditions have to be met by tax accounting team before claiming VAT/GST input credit.</p>
   <h6 align="left">4. Transfer Pricing</h6>   <p>In today’s world of globalization
, many companies open their branches in various parts of the world. A policy monitors transfer pricing called an Arm’s Length transaction
 Pricing, which advocates the fair-trade policy across the globe. In simple words, it says that a related part or person should not avail good or services at a lower cost than the price at which it has been sold to an unrelated third party.</p>
   <h6 align="left">5. Categorisation of Income</h6>   <p>Accounting considers all the receipts and payments for calculating the accounting profit. However, not all receipts are related to business, and the rate of tax differs depending on the type of receipt it is.</p>
