        <Accordion.Header>Quick Tips for Time Management #2</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
        <img   src="/financial/time-management.jpg" alt="" /> 
       <p>In any field of business or personal life, time management plays an important role in ensuring work is done on time and with maximum efficiency. A few important steps and tips for effective time management are as follows:</p>
       
       <ol>
        <li>Set Goals: For any individual, it is important to set the final objective or goals which need to be achieved. This is the first step in effective time management.</li>
         <li> Prioritize Work: Certain tasks are more important as compared to others. Hence time management involves prioritizing work and goals so that accordingly time and resources can be allocated.</li>
         <li>Define Time Limits: Every task needs to be given a certain time period to be completed. Thus, defining a certain time period is required in the management of tasks to be done to achieve goals.</li>
      <li>Organize Resources:Time management requires that resources which are needed to execute a task are arranged and organized. If that is not done, then there are delays and which eventually leads to incomplete tasks.</li>
      <li> Delegate Work:Time management also observes that a single individual cannot perform all the tasks single-handedly. Hence delegation of work needs to be done so that workload is divided into smaller goals & tasks, and together it helps to achieve the final goals.</li>
      <li>Reduce Redundancies:Based on priority, there are certain tasks which can be avoided or certain processes which are redundant. It is utmost important that the non-priority tasks and irrelevant processes are reduced.</li>
      <li>Avoid Stress:Time management should be done in such a way that it creates a stress-free working environment. Based on planning and prioritizing, stressful work situations must be avoided, as stress will lead to poor efficiency and work output.</li>
      <li>Pre-Plan Tasks:Planning for tasks beforehand is a thumb-rule for effective management. Any individual should not only plan for the tasks at hand, but also consider situations where there is a delay, failure or emergency task which need to be performed. There is no single way in which a person learns effective time management but it is a gradual process which takes time to learn and develop those skills.</li>
       </ol>
       <ul>
        <h6 align="left">Advantages of Time Management</h6>

        <Accordion.Header>The 4 Ds of Time Management #3</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
       <h4 align="left">What are the 4 Ds of Time Management?</h4>
      <p>The 4 Ds of time management, sometimes referred to as the 4 Ds of productivity, is a popular strategy for discerning whether or not a task or project is worth your time. It involves making a quick decision about what to act on now either by doing it yourself or delegating to someone else, what to act on in the future, or what to drop from your to-do list.The 4 Ds are: Do, Defer (Delay), Delegate, and Delete (Drop). Placing a task or project into one of these categories helps you manage your limited time more effectively and stay focused on what matters most to you.</p>
    <h4 align="left"> Why are the 4 Ds Important for Product Managers?</h4>  <p>Product managers (PMs) are notoriously busy and have a million and one requests and demands vying for their attention and time every day, all day. To keep projects and people moving in the right direction, PMs must effectively prioritize the constant flow of tasks to stay focused on what truly matters. Successful PMs become masters of time management.</p>
    <h4 align="left">How to Apply the 4 Ds Technique</h4><p>We all have an ever-growing to-do list, and PMs are certainly no exception. Because our responsibilities and demands limit our time, we have to choose carefully how we spend this precious resource to make sure that we align our tasks with our larger goals.To get started with the 4 Ds technique, look at your to-do list at the beginning of the workday and assess which tasks can be done quickly right now either by you or someone else on your team, which ones to drop altogether, and which essential tasks to defer for now.</p>
    <img   src="/financial/4-Ds-time-management.jpg" alt="" /> 
       <h6 align="left">1. Delete</h6>
       <p> This first action enables the project manager to eliminate any unimportant tasks and/or projects from your endless list. Anything that’s assigned to this category represents something that’s not worth your precious time. Attending unnecessary meetings that won’t affect you and saying yes to every request is something that you can avoid to stay ahead of these unnecessary tasks.</p>
       <h6 align="left">2. Delegate</h6>
       <p>When there’s an important task to tackle, but you find yourself with something that can only be completed by yourself, this is the time to engage in the second act.Delegating a task means that you’re assigning that responsibility to someone else on your behalf. For example, reports are something essential to complete in order to document the progress of the project.This is something that you can ideally delegate to one of your team members while you’re dealing with time-sensitive matters.</p>
       <h6 align="left">3. Defer</h6>
       <p>This third action aims to pause any task that was assigned to someone because it doesn’t need to be taken care of right away.This happens when there’s a priority task that needs everyone’s attention. However, this doesn’t mean that this task won’t be completed, instead, it will be revisited when there’s free time in the team’s pipeline.For example, you don’t have to read all of your e-mails right away. You can finish more important tasks and once you have free time you can read your pending e-mails.</p>
       <h6 align="left">4. Do </h6>
       <p>The fourth action entails the completion of the tasks that you have available in your pipeline. These are normally urgent tasks that require your attention and must be completed as soon as possible.A perfect example is a scheduled task, such as a presentation, where you meet your deadline. If you don’t respect the tasks of this fourth category, the aftermath could be catastrophic. </p>
        <h6 align="left">Why are the 4 D’s important for time management?</h6>
        <p>The importance behind establishing the 4 D’s of time management stands on the filtration of tasks to help project managers. Every day they have to deal with multiple requests from various sources, which makes their job very difficult.That’s when the 4 D’s of time management enter the conversation and transform how everyday tasks are organized. Through the assignment of each task to a category, you’re able to keep everything organized and filtered, which means that the project can run smoothly throughout its process.  What will happen is that the product manager won’t feel so overwhelmed due to the assignment of tasks. The main goal is that everyone will remain focused to work towards completing the tasks at hand, as well as the project itself.At last, time management will be tamed, and consequently, you’ll reach the peak of your productivity.</p>
        <img   src="/financial/time.png" alt="" /> 
        <h6 align="left" > How to use the 4 D’s of time management</h6>
       <p> Before getting started on any tasks whatsoever, it’s important that you take a look at your to-do list in a more whole-type of view. You can separate each element through a chart and insert every task into every category. Here’s an example of how you can apply the 4 D’s:</p>
       <p> This is a great tool to optimize your time because you’ll be able to display what you have on your pipeline and have a clear view of what you prioritize. The rest of the tasks you can also delegate, delay and even eliminate them.However, it’s necessary that you establish a goal before getting involved in anything. For example, what do you hope to achieve by taking advantage of this model? Once you find the answer to that question, you’ll have the green light to pursue the steps created for the 4 D’s of time management.
Assigning each task to its category seems challenging, but it’s essential for developing this method and your project’s progress. Remember that doing this difficult definition will save you immeasurable hours of work that you could use on your urgent and important tasks.
Once you’ve overcome that challenge, you’ll have the practice you need to follow through with the rest of the steps. You’ll find yourself and your team more organized and structured than you’ve ever seen before.This great tool will help you fight the professional burnout and stress you might feel when you’re overwhelmed with tasks and organization.</p>

        <Accordion.Header> Time Management Secrets For Entrepreneurs #4</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
          <h6 align="left">Plan your days ahead</h6><p>Before leaving the office in the evening, take the time to create a detailed to-do list for the next day. You should assign blocks of time for working on specific tasks and activities on your list. The next morning, you’ll be ready to hit the ground running.</p>
      <h6 align="left">Expect the unexpected</h6><p> You know they’re coming: Those unforeseen events that eat up your time. Israel recommends reserving one hour in the morning and one hour in the afternoon for putting out fires. But to make it work, you have to resist the temptation to drop everything to deal with emergencies and wait until the time you’ve set aside to attack them.</p>
      <h6 align="left"> Block out time for strategy</h6><p>At the beginning of the year, you should reserve time in your calendar for weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual and annual planning sessions.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Friday afternoon is a good time to look at what you’ve accomplished during the week and look ahead to next week’s activities.</li>
      <li>Monthly and quarterly sessions are for digging progressively deeper into the company’s finances looking to understand the reasons for variances from budget and planning how to adjust. You should also be reviewing operations, product development, customer feedback, employee performance and competitor activities.</li>
      <li> Semi-annual sessions are for updating the strategic plan and once a year it’s budget time.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>"It’s important to block those times off," Israel says. "Because if you don’t, when the time comes for that activity, there will be an emergency and you will postpone it and procrastinate."</p>  
    <h6 align="left">Get tough with distractions</h6>
       <p> Email and the telephone are a constant source of distraction and temptation. Checking your inbox or calling an associate are often procrastination disguised as work. These activities break your concentration, interfering with the important work you have to do. Israel recommends you reserve 10 to 15 minutes an hour for email and phone calls.</p>
        <h6  align="left">Profit from lunch time</h6><p>Many entrepreneurs, especially those with an introverted nature, prefer to eat their lunch at their desk or slip away for a solitary bite. Israel says that’s a mistake. Lunch is a time when you can learn and deepen relationships with people who are important to your business. Israel says entrepreneurs should make the effort to break bread each day with a varying cast of people including employees, customers, suppliers, competitors and potential partners.
The bottom line is that to be successful, entrepreneurs have to become good managers and that starts with managing one’s self."The business becomes successful when you transform yourself into a professional manager," Israel says. "And that means you have to change your attitude and focus on what you need to do, not what you like to do."</p>

        <Accordion.Header>Time Management strategies #6</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
       <h5 align="left"> 1. Conduct a time audit.</h5>
          <p>Start by assessing where you actually spend your time. Create a visual map of the approximate hours you spend on work, school, housework and chores, commuting, social media, and leisure activities. Then, you can drill in on school or work, dividing your previous week into days, then hours. How much time did it take to finish that paper? Did a work project take longer because you were scrolling on your phone? Set goals based on this outcome. Planning ahead and setting time limits on your tasks and priorities can free up time for what’s most important to you, like spending more time with friends and family.Start by dedicating a half hour every Sunday to intentionally planning your week ahead and setting daily goals.</p>
         <h5 align="left"> 2. Use the Eisenhower Matrix to set your priorities.</h5>
         <p>The Eisenhower Matrix is a popular tool that helps you distinguish between tasks that are important, not important, urgent, and not urgent. The quadrant has four boxes in which you can split your tasks to prioritize what you should focus on first. They also correspond with the 4 D’s of execution: do, defer, delegate, and delete.</p>
         <ul>
          <li>Quadrant 1: Important and urgent. Do these tasks first. These are the priorities that are most relevant to your goals.</li>
           <li>Quadrant 2: Important but not urgent. Defer these for later in your schedule.</li>
            <li>Quadrant 3: Urgent but not important. Delegate these to others, if possible, especially if they do not contribute to your long-term goals.</li>
           <li>Quadrant 4: Not important and not urgent. Delete these tasks, or do them when you have free time because they are distractions from your priorities.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>For an even simpler approach, create a task list and mark each item as urgent or important. Often, we prioritize urgent tasks instead of important ones—such as tasks that may be creative, important, and fulfilling but do not have a deadline—so identifying and labeling them can be a helpful step toward accomplishing your personal and professional goals.</p>
          <h5 align="left">3. Employ methods to “chunk” your time.</h5>
          <p>Once you have a better idea of what your priorities are, setting limits can be an excellent time management tool. There are several options for chunking your time into digestible pieces.
Try the Pomodoro method. This technique was developed in the late 1980s by Francesco Cirillo, a university student who was overwhelmed by studying and assignments. The Pomodoro method requires using a timer to break down your work into 25-minute intervals, separated by 5 minutes of break time. After four pomodoros, you may take a longer 15-30 minute break. Pomodoro (“tomato” in Italian) promotes concentration and relieves mental fatigue, which is especially useful for open-ended work like conducting research, studying for an exam, or finishing a consulting project.
By “chunking” time, you make big projects and goals less daunting. Less procrastination, more productivity.</p>
<h5 align="left">4. Focus on one thing at a time. </h5><p>For most of us, multitasking is generally less efficient than focusing on one task at a time. In fact, one study found that only 2.5 percent of people are able to multitask effectively [4]. Doing too many things at once can impact your cognitive ability, making you feel unproductive or dissatisfied with your progress. Arranging your time so that you complete one task before starting another can boost your confidence.
Further, it may be helpful to compartmentalize tasks. If you are a writer, for example, you might dedicate Monday to research, Tuesday through Thursday to writing, and Friday to editing. </p>
<h5 align="left">5. Give yourself a reward.</h5><p>Rewards can be a great source of motivation for adopting good time management habits. For each important task you accomplish, you can give yourself a little treat. It doesn't need to be extravagant or expensive. Here are some simple ways to motivate yourself:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Taking a break to enjoy your favorite snack</li>
        <li>Going for a short walk outside</li>
        <li>Call a friend or family member</li>
        <li>Meditate for five minutes</li>
        <li>Listen to a podcast episode or a chapter of an audiobook</li>
       </ul>
       <p>For bigger rewards, you can indulge in activities like reading a book in the bath, planning a night out with friends, or booking a getaway. Exciting rewards can help you push through an especially tough project or work period</p>
         <h5 align="left"> 6. Use apps to block out distractions.</h5>
         <p>Sometimes, rewards and good intentions are not enough to keep us focused. An app or browser extension can help you minimize distractions by blocking you from using social media or touching your phone. Here are some apps and extensions you can try:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Forest is an app that helps you stay focused and off your phone. The company partners with an organization called Trees for the Future to plant trees when you spend virtual coins earned in Forest.</li>
       <li> StayFocused is a browser extension that prevents you from using time-wasting websites like Reddit, Twitter, Wikipedia, Instagram, and more. It’s highly configurable, so you can customize it to your specific distractions.</li>
     <li>Freedom is a tool that can block both websites and apps on all of your devices, simultaneously. Take advantage of their free trial to know if it’s right for you.</li>
       </ul>

        <Accordion.Header>How to create your own time management strategy #7</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
          <p>Now that you have some potential time management tips and methods in your toolkit, it’s time to create a strategy. You might experiment with several techniques before establishing the most effective long-term habits and routines for you.</p>
       <h4  align="left">Establish goals and priorities.</h4><p>Consider your lifestyle, whether you are a student or a working professional (or both), whether you have a family or aspire to become a digital nomad (or both!). Think of your long- and short-term goals for your career and personal development. Make sure the goals are SMART: specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and timely. What will it take to achieve them? How can you manage your time to maximize your productivity? Once you have established your goals, prioritize them in order of importance. It may be helpful to use Post-its or pen and paper to visualize them.</p>
       <h4  align="left">Choose the best method for you.</h4><p>Using the list of tips above, decide upon a method or two to implement. Based on what has worked for you in the past, you can mix and match different time management skills. If you are unsure of which ones will work for you, pick one at random and give it a try.</p>
       <h4  align="left">Plan and implement.</h4><p>Apply your chosen method over a period of time. A month is typically enough time to evaluate whether a strategy is working. Over 30 days, monitor your progress. Take notes on how you feel after one or two weeks. Was one method more effective than the other? </p>
       <h4  align="left">Reassess.</h4><p>After one month of your new time management methods, it’s time to reassess. What’s working? What’s not working? Adjust your strategy and plan to be more effective. Continue to practice these habits each month, adapting them as your priorities change. What works for you when you are a student may not be the same as when you start a new job.
Remember, practicing time management is an ongoing process, and life happens. It’s about progress, not perfection.</p>
