        <li>Linking your current and future savings to your goals</li>
        <li>Create alternatives – Developing alternatives is crucial for making a sound financial plan. Although many factors will influence the available options, possible courses of action usually fall into these categories:</li>
      <li>Continue the same course of action – Stick with current investment & savings plan.</li>
