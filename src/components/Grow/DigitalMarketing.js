          <h4 align="left">What is Digital Marketing?</h4>
         <p>Digital marketing is the practice of promoting products or services with the help of digital devices and technology.
In simple words, digital marketing is any form of marketing that occurs online with the help of mobile, laptop, internet, etc. In addition to digital signage and technology that may not be connected to the internet. It can range from anything as complex as automated email marketing initiatives all the way down to the content choices on your website’s blog.
Now, you know what is digital marketing, so let's proceed and know the types of digital marketing.</p>
<img className="step" src="/financial/digital-marketing.png" alt="" />
       <h4 align="left">Types of Digital Marketing</h4>
       <p>If you have a computer or a smartphone, as many of us do, you’ve experienced digital marketing. It could be an email in your inbox, a search result when using Google, an ad on Facebook, a text message sent to your phone, or a post by an influencer on Instagram. As you can see, internet marketing is an expansive field with many areas of specialization. The core forms of digital marketing, however, are:</p>
       <ol>
        <li>Search Engine Optimization (SEO):- SEO involves optimizing your website and online content to rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs). This helps increase organic (non-paid) traffic to your website.</li>
     <li>Paid Social and Paid Search Advertising:- Ads that appear on social media are paid social ads, and all that seems on SERPs when you enter a query are paid search ads. Advertisers create these paid ads and compete with others for positions on their chosen social platform or the SERP for their selected search engine.</li>
     <li>Email Marketing:-Any marketing that occurs through email is known as email marketing, and it’s not just for newsletters and coupons. All marketing-related interaction over email fits into this category.</li>
     <li>Content Marketing:-Every effort to market through online content is considered content marketing (and often employs SEO, paid search, and paid social advertising). For example, all these content types (and more) are grouped under the content marketing category:
      <ul>
        <li>Blog posts</li>
        <li>Infographics</li>
        <li>Videos</li>
        <li>eBooks</li>
        <li>White papers </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> Affiliate Marketing:-Affiliate marketing is a type of digital marketing in which companies reach out to third party websites to advertise their products and services. These are also known as referrals. The target audience of the affiliate website becomes important in this aspect of digital marketing. Some of the ways that affiliates are incentivized are based on:</li>
     <ul>
      <li>Registrations</li>
      <li>Email sign-ups</li>
      <li>Sales and</li>
      <li>Subscriptions</li>
     </ul>
     <li>Mobile Marketing:-Mobile Marketing is a type of digital marketing focused on reaching the target audience via mobile devices. We all are excessive users of mobile devices and there is a good chance of tapping on to their attention by following simple marketing strategies. Push notifications, emailers, social media posts, MMS, SMS, newsletters are a part of Mobile Marketing. </li>
      <li>Social Media Marketing:-Social Media Marketing is a practice that increases brand awareness, and helps brands achieve their marketing objectives. A wide range of content buckets are available for social media marketing like videos, memes, static posts, trending posts, testimonials, stories, reels, etc.. If you perform SMM properly, there is a high chance that your conversion rates will increase, you will be able to build a good top-funnel traffic, and your paid marketing cost will go down. </li>

        <Accordion.Header>Why digital marketing is important for business #2</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
          <p> Well, there are a whole host of reasons that we will explore in this section, but in simple terms, it allows you to reach a larger audience and boost brand awareness.All of the reasons we list here, if applied correctly, should help you to attract customers new and old and drive future sales.</p>
          <img className="step" src="/financial/importance-of-digital-marketing.jpg" alt="" />
       <h6 align="left">Good for brand growth and awareness</h6><p>Digital marketing levels the playing field and allows you to compete with bigger brands in your sector that otherwise wouldn’t be achievable. The internet is home to a huge source of potential customers, so by marketing your brand using the above techniques we discussed, you’re able to target a lot more people than you would normally.Using these different digital marketing channels, your brand will grow and become more widely recognised, helping to raise awareness about what you do and the products or services you sell.</p>
       <h6 align="left">Targets online customers</h6><p> As of January 2023, there were 5.16 billion internet users worldwide, which means there are quite literally billions of people out there that may be interested in your brand. 
Your customers are online waiting to discover your brand and a good digital marketing strategy will be able to tap into this potential. The more exposure your brand receives, the more likely you’ll attract new customers.
The majority of people now use the internet to find out about businesses, so you’d be crazy to not have an online presence and be involved in the conversation. If people can’t find your business online, then the chances are that they’ll choose a competitor and you’ll lose a potential customer.</p>
<h6 align="left">Affordable</h6><p>Digital marketing is a lot more cost-effective than traditional marketing methods, which is ideal for businesses that have limited funds and resources. You also have complete control over how you spend your money, targeting certain marketing streams depending on your needs. For example, using Google Ads or commissioning some time with a videographer. It also allows you to be flexible with your money, pivoting to different marketing strategies when required. This reduces the risk of wasting precious finances and ensures money gets allocated effectively.</p>
      <h6 align="left">Measurable</h6><p>Another great reason why digital marketing is important and superior to traditional marketing tools is that it’s measurable. With digital marketing, you’ll have access to a huge source of data and metrics, whether that’s impressions, views, time on a page, click rate, and so on. This means you can see accurate data in real-time.This is invaluable when it comes to evaluating how well your brand’s digital marketing strategy is performing and allows you to reallocate time and money to other areas if a particular campaign is underperforming. </p>
      <h6 align="left" >Faster and more efficient</h6><p>Implementing digital marketing strategies can also be a lot quicker and more efficient, as you’ll be able to start the process immediately. Even if money or resources are a little tight, there are still things you can do to get the ball rolling and help improve your brand’s online presence, such as increasing social media post frequency and implementing some basic SEO on your website.Some of the traditional marketing techniques can also be incredibly time-consuming, whereas digital marketing helps to free up precious time and reallocate it accordingly.</p>
      <h6 align="left" >Good return on investment</h6><p>Digital marketing allows you to track day-to-day campaign performance, ensuring you know what channels are performing and which are struggling. This helps you to optimise campaign budgets for high return on investment (ROI). It is widely recognised that businesses that invest in online advertisements and marketing have a better ROI.</p>
      <h6 align="left" >Reaches out to mobile users</h6><p>There are approximately 6.84 billion smartphones in the world, with 4.76 billion people using social media globally. A well-crafted digital marketing strategy is your best chance of reaching this massive audience and failure to do so will mean you’re missing out on a huge amount of customer potential.As a society, we are glued to our mobile phones, relying on them to communicate, shop, manage finances, and more importantly, search the internet for brands that resonate with us. You need to ensure your website is compatible with mobiles and the user journey is well-suited for smartphone users. </p>
      <h6 align="left">Allows you to stand out from your competitors </h6><p>Trust us when we say that your competitors are already using effective digital marketing tools to further their business. So, if you’re not doing it yet, then it’s essential that you make a start now. 

There are countless reasons why digital marketing is important for businesses, but staying ahead of the competition is certainly one of the best.

It’s always work checking in with your competitors to see what they are doing and assessing how you can do things better. Ultimately, you want to have a better digital marketing strategy that drives more traffic to your brand and attracts a larger share of customers.</p>

        <Accordion.Header>Does Digital Marketing Work For All Businesses? #3</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
        <p>Digital marketing can work for any business—regardless of the size or the niche. Digital marketing is used to understand the consumer’s needs and create valuable and relatable content for them. However, this does not suggest that every business should have the same or similar digital marketing strategies. Some marketing strategies that can be incorporated into digital marketing are social media marketing, search engine optimisation, search engine marketing, content marketing, email marketing, and pay-per-click advertising.In simpler words, digital marketing is a gateway between marketing psychology and electronic technology. You must ensure that digital marketing is incorporated into your marketing strategy to control the information that goes out and into this gateway.</p>
      <p>The two major types of marketing include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>B2B (business to business) marketing</li>
         <li>B2C (business to customer) marketing</li>
      </ul>
      <h6 align="left">B2B Marketing</h6>
      <p>B2B marketing focuses more on the logic of the product and its features. As this type of marketing involves little to no emotion in the purchase decision, understanding the buyers and how their organisation procedures play a role in the purchase decision becomes essential. B2B marketing is more about how the business uses a product than the product being promoted. 
For instance, suppose your business sells productivity software. If you sell this product to businesses, the point of focus should be on how the software will save your prospective client money in the form of time. With your software, the client and their employees will be able to get more work done in the same amount of time. </p>
<img className="" src="/financial/b2b.jpg" alt="" />
<h6 align="left">B2C Marketing</h6>
<p>B2C marketing focuses more on the benefits of the product. The decision that consumers make will involve a lot more emotion when compared with businesses buying a product through B2B marketing. With each consumer having a different preference, they may demand a wide variety of distribution channels for their convenience. Also, consumers may lose interest if your marketing message is long. Hence, to grab the consumer’s attention, get right to the point instead of beating around the bush.
An interesting point to note about B2C marketing is that consumers do not want to understand the benefits of the product or service on their own. Instead, they expect the brand to point out the benefits of the product to make things clear for them. Unlike B2B marketing, the purchasing process of consumers is much shorter than that of businesses. 
To ensure your B2C marketing strategy is effective on the consumers, your focus should be on bringing out the benefits and results of the product or service. 
Consider the example of the productivity software mentioned earlier. Now, imagine you are selling it directly to the consumers. While making a purchase, the consumers would want you to explain how the software and its features will prove beneficial. 
Unlike B2B marketing, consumers do not look for a return on their investment. They simply look for a product or service that will make their lives a little easier.</p>

        <Accordion.Header>Digital Marketing Strategies #5</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
          <h4 align="left" >Digital Marketing Strategies Every Business Should Use Today</h4>
          <p>A thought-through and innovative strategy is the foundation of any effective digital marketing plan. It lays out a plan to help you understand your end marketing goals and ways to get there. All businesses need a digital marketing strategy, but how to ensure that it will set you up for success?
Let’s look at some smart ways to craft an effective digital marketing strategy:</p>
<img   className="" src="/financial/start.jpg" alt="" />
<br/><br/><h6 align="left">Research & Insights are your ammunition</h6><p>Ever wondered why some social media campaigns are a success and others are not? The key here is the quality of research. In the digital marketing world, it’s no surprise that social media is your best friend. It’s just so easy to share content and get people talking. But if you don’t know where and how to start, it can be quite a challenge. Make sure to gather data on how your target audience is using social media, customer behavior, expectations and demographics, so that you are in the right direction from the very beginning</p>
<h6 align="left">Know the Target Audience</h6><p>Understanding the target audience and problem areas of your product or service can be overwhelming because of the sheer magnitude of information, but you should know this information inside-out, as an effective marketer. These two key terms are closely linked because they help you understand the purpose of marketing. The target audience means who you are marketing to, and the problem area means what you are marketing for.</p>
<h6 align="left">Storytelling is the key to a good strategy</h6><p>Storytelling is an art in itself and a creative way to connect with anyone. The greatest storytellers create a sense of wonder, curiosity, and suspense that can get anyone to stay glued to what they have to say. Once your audience is hooked, you can lead them to the message you want them to hear. This is the first step in making sure that your clients get the message you want them to hear and resonate with it.</p>
<h6 align="left">Your strategy should be insight-driven & a problem-solvere</h6><p>Insight-driven and problem-solving are two key components of a digital marketing strategy that will help your efforts be successful. Without insight into the target audience’s pain points and wants, your digital marketing efforts will be incomplete and ineffective. It could lead to a lower ROI, leading to wastage of marketing budgets. Further, if your digital marketing strategy doesn’t solve a problem and make the target audience’s lives easier, they won’t be as likely to support you, and your business could go downhill!</p>     
<h6  align="left">Play on the strength of every platform</h6><p>Many digital marketers over-analyze their marketing strategies to the point of exhaustion. With data from so many platforms, it’s easy to get lost in the numbers. Make sure you’re exploring the right ones; after all, the wild world of digital marketing is often a path of discovery and development. Platforms like Twitter and Instagram have unique strengths that should be leveraged. They’re fast, and you can quickly create a buzz. But, it may be better to have corporate synergy with more traditional marketing methods like television and print. If you can master the art of mixing the two, you’ll have a powerful strategy that your competitors won’t be able to mimic.

At the end of the day, a good strategy is all that you need to stay on the right track, especially when it comes to marketing. With new platforms and social media sites popping up all the time, it is natural to lose focus on what will help your business grow. We hope these insights help you achieve the best and #MakeBigHappen.</p>
